title: How i flunked my term paper review session
---

i am keeping this blog so that i can recollect things i have done and i have no other reasons (nihilist).gmrit ece third year student who is interested in a.i and combinatorics and nothing else.


my reviewers are retards and i chose to survey on generative adversial networks .

so i thought it would be good to start with convolutional neural networks and thats what i did. my peers did their papers on stupid stuff like brain to brain communication blablabla...

i have been in the area of convolutional neural networks since last year , i took cs231n i played with almost every deeplearning library i can download even without a gpu and internet . tried hard to understand every paper on it .

they said i should make a presentation of atmost 15 slides(retards) so i made a noob level presentation on it and my reviewer saw the first slide of it and said that i am going to get a zero .

go through my bullshit powerpoint presentation if you have no other thing to do.
