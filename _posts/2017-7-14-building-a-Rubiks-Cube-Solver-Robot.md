title:rubiks 
---

my vice principal is a good man , he said that if i were able to build a robot that solves a rubiks cube by this july 31st then 
he will be happy.

so i am going to build one for him(tony stark)


i know that two phase algorithm can solve a rubiks cube in ~20 moves (kociemba) all i need is a brain , a camera sensor,
to extract colours and x6 stepper motors and some time.


six stepper motors? way too high for my budget .
anyway gonna give it a try in my spare time this series of posts will be on that
